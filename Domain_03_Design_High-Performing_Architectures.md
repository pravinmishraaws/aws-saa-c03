## **2. AWS Storage Gateway – Key Hybrid Storage Solution**
AWS Storage Gateway **bridges on-premises storage with AWS services**. It provides **three main types of gateways**:

| **Gateway Type** | **Description** | **Use Case** |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------|
| **File Gateway** | Provides an SMB/NFS interface to Amazon S3. | Migrate file shares to AWS with S3-backed storage. |
| **Volume Gateway** | Presents iSCSI volumes that back up to Amazon S3 and EBS snapshots. | Backup and disaster recovery for block storage. |
| **Tape Gateway** | Virtual tape library (VTL) backed by Amazon S3 Glacier. | Replaces physical tape storage for archiving. |

### **Exam Scenarios for AWS Storage Gateway**
- **How to extend an on-prem file share to AWS?** → Use **File Gateway**.
